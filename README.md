# Password Manager

This project is a command-line application built in Python that allows users to:
- Create new accounts with a username and password
- Log in using existing credentials
- Cancel account creation or login at any time
- Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully


## Features
- **User Authentication**: Basic login and account creation workflow
- **File Handling**: Credentials stored in `users.txt` for persistence
- **Error Handling**: Input validation with `try/except` blocks
- **Modular Functions**: Helper functions (`userExists`, `getUserCredentials`) for clean, reusable code


## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **File handling** for storing passwords


## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
- Implement stronger encryption
- Add password generation feature
- Allow search functionality
- Store data in a structured JSON file or SQLite database
- Delete stored entries

## What I Learned
- Working with files in Python (read/write)
- Basic data persistence
- Building a console-based program
- Organizing a small software project
